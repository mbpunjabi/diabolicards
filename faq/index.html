<details class="card"><summary><strong>What’s the goal of Diabolicards?</strong></summary><p>Build, steal, or eliminate power using card abilities and zone placement. When no legal plays are possible by all players, the side with the highest total power wins — a tie is a tie.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>How many players can play?</strong></summary><p>You can play 1v1 or 2v2.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>Where do teammates sit and what can they communicate?</strong></summary><p>Teammates sit on the same side of the mat, but they cannot look at each other’s cards or talk to each other; friendly banter against the other side is encouraged.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>What’s inside the box?</strong></summary><p>An 80‑card deck with 11 groups, a two‑sided mat with three zones on each side and card slots, and a printed guide.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>How do we set up the starting hands?</strong></summary><p>1v1: each player draws 6. 2v2: each player draws 5.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>How do we set up the initial Contracts?</strong></summary><p>1v1: each player transfers 2 cards face‑up to Contract slots. 2v2: each player transfers 1 card face‑up to Contract slots.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>Who takes the first turn?</strong></summary><p>Anyone from any side can start — decide wisely.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>What is a ‘legal play’?</strong></summary><p>Playing a card into a zone slot that allows it (following slot rules and any current ability constraints).</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>What happens if there’s no space to play any type of card?</strong></summary><p>You must pass your turns until space is created by other players in any of your zones.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>What happens if I run out of legal plays later in the game?</strong></summary><p>You keep passing until a legal play becomes possible.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>What happens if I run out of cards in hand?</strong></summary><p>You pass permanently, and the game continues until other player(s) also run out of cards at hand or legal plays.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>How do I calculate the winner at game end?</strong></summary><p>Sum all alive cards’ powers on each side, apply the latest boost/hinder effects, then add synergy bonuses per zone (respecting the synergy cap). Highest power wins; ties stand.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>What are the three zones on each side?</strong></summary><p>From left to right: Vask Tower, The Gang Hideout, and Havenvale Campus.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>How many slots does each zone have?</strong></summary><p>Each zone has 9 slots: 8 for regular or diabolical cards, and 1 bottom slot dedicated to diabolical activation.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>Where do Scorched Earth cards go on the mat?</strong></summary><p>They have no dedicated slots — they occupy the empty spaces around zone names.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>Can any card be played in any zone?</strong></summary><p>All cards can be placed in any slot for power (as long as slot rules are followed) and at any time. However, linked groups have ability restrictions.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>Which card groups are zone‑linked?</strong></summary><p>Vask Executives ↔ Vask Tower; The Gang ↔ The Gang Hideout; Havenvale Batch ↔ Havenvale Campus.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>What’s the rule for abilities of zone‑linked groups?</strong></summary><p>Those three linked groups can only use abilities in their respective zones; other groups can use abilities anywhere.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>What is ‘synergy’ and how much can I gain?</strong></summary><p>If a linked group card is placed in its linked zone and survives to the end, it contributes +1 synergy point to that zone. Synergy is capped at +4 per zone.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>What’s on a card at a glance?</strong></summary><p>Power value; the card’s group; a symbols panel; an ability description; and name & type (Human/Apex) plus gender — some abilities care about type or gender.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>Do abilities usually affect the whole board?</strong></summary><p>Usually a card’s ability affects only the zone it’s in, and most are single, instant‑use. If an ability is lost, it can’t be restarted unless another ability says so.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>What are the ability categories?</strong></summary><p>Boost/Hinder, Movement, Kill Capable, Turn Affect, and Cheat Death; some groups (‘Why Even’, ‘Doomed Squad’) bend categorization.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>How does Boost work?</strong></summary><p>Boost (or be boosted) to power 8, anchored by its own symbol — see the card text/symbols.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>How does Hinder work?</strong></summary><p>It reduces the target’s power, typically to 0 — see the card text/symbols.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>Which ability wins if multiple boosts/hinders apply?</strong></summary><p>The latest boost/hinder takes over.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>What do Movement abilities do?</strong></summary><p>They move yourself, or move teammates or enemies across zones; note Spiderloom’s ‘Why Stick’ can block movement.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>What is ‘Cheat Death’?</strong></summary><p>Abilities like Deathdodge/Runaway are the only ones that can save themselves from Kill abilities.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>What are ‘Turn Affect’ abilities?</strong></summary><p>Abilities such as Turntable or Fate Purge that change or extend the Usual Turn.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>Do Kill‑capable abilities affect teammates?</strong></summary><p>They may — check the specific card text. Some kills can hit your own side.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>What happens during a Usual Turn?</strong></summary><p>Step 1: play one legal card. Step 2: announce/resolve abilities. Step 3: announce a kill choice if applicable. Step 4: opponents may counter if they remember. Step 5: opponents discard dead cards (permanent death if a savable card is discarded). Step 6: if the deck isn’t empty, draw one; end turn.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>What are Contracts in plain terms?</strong></summary><p>A high‑risk, high‑reward way to control luck using four face‑up cards that stay visible for trading or purging.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>When is a Contract Turn allowed?</strong></summary><p>Only if the main deck has 10 or more cards.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>Can I take Contract Turns back‑to‑back?</strong></summary><p>No. You can’t use Contract Turns consecutively — every Contract Turn must be followed by a Usual Turn.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>What happens if the main deck drops below 10 cards?</strong></summary><p>Contract Turns are banned for the rest of the game (unless a specific ability like ‘Rewind’ changes this).</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>Which card groups are NOT contract‑eligible?</strong></summary><p>Scorched Earth and The Diabolicals are non‑eligible — they can’t be traded in or out of contract slots.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>Can Scorched Earth or Diabolicals appear in contracts at setup?</strong></summary><p>Yes, but only as initial contract cards during setup.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>What causes a Contract Freeze?</strong></summary><p>If all contract slots hold non‑eligible cards (Scorched Earth or Diabolicals), contracts are frozen.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>How can a Contract Freeze be cleared?</strong></summary><p>Only via a Contract Purge — and a purge is dependent on the deck’s state.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>What happens if, after a Contract Trade, no eligible contract cards remain?</strong></summary><p>A Contract Purge happens automatically (which can heavily deplete the main deck).</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>What is a Contract Trade?</strong></summary><p>Transfer 1 card between your hand and an empty contract slot; the card in contracts is always face‑up.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>What is a Contract Purge?</strong></summary><p>Transfer all four contract cards back into the main deck, shuffle, then reveal four new face‑up contract cards to the slots.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>Do Contract Turns discard cards from the main deck?</strong></summary><p>They can — every Contract Turn can result in one or more cards being discarded from the main deck; use contracts with caution.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>Are all card groups regular?</strong></summary><p>All groups are regular except The Diabolicals and Scorched Earth.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>How do Scorched Earth abilities interact with others?</strong></summary><p>They affect all other groups, and only affect each other in specific scenarios.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>How do Diabolical abilities interact?</strong></summary><p>When placed in a diabolical slot (activated), diabolical abilities affect all groups except Scorched Earth and other diabolicals in diabolical slots.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>What are ‘The Last Two’?</strong></summary><p>Deathrender and Razor — the only Scorched Earth cards — extremely powerful and risky.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>What’s the ‘Scorch the Earth’ scenario?</strong></summary><p>If both sides each have a Scorched Earth card and both are played in the same zone, and that zone becomes completely empty on both sides after the second card resolves, both cards fight to the death (are discarded) and the zone is permanently sealed for both sides — no cards of any group can be played there.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>What’s the ‘How Dare You’ scenario?</strong></summary><p>If one side has both Scorched Earth cards, a global rule applies: both cannot use the same Endgame choice regardless of zone. If both are played in the same zone, they fight to the death (discarded) and Scorched Earth is not triggered.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>What are the Endgame choices granted by Scorched Earth cards?</strong></summary><p>Choose exactly one: (1) kill enemy zone entirely (including Diabolicals); (2) kill your own zone entirely (including Diabolicals); (3) kill both same zones entirely (including Diabolicals); or (4) do nothing.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>Do Scorched Earth choices apply if cards are in different zones?</strong></summary><p>Yes — the global rule (no same Endgame choice) still applies across zones.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>How do Diabolicals ‘activate’ and what’s their immunity?</strong></summary><p>Placing a Diabolical in its dedicated diabolical slot activates its ability and grants immunity from regular and other diabolical abilities; only Scorched Earth can then affect it.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>What if a Diabolical is placed in a regular slot?</strong></summary><p>It behaves like a regular Apex: it loses its ability and becomes vulnerable to any ability.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>Can a Diabolical be moved between diabolical and regular slots?</strong></summary><p>No — once placed, a Diabolical cannot be moved between those slot types.</p></details>
<details class="card"><summary><strong>How are abilities and slots connected overall?</strong></summary><p>Abilities often depend on group and zone; linked groups must be in their zone to use abilities, and Diabolicals need their dedicated slot to activate.</p></details>
